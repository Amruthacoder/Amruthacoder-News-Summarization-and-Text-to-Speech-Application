CONTENT:
We got an early hands-on look at Samsung's mixed-reality headset and Google's glasses, powered by an all-seeing assistant. I've used many VR and AR headsets and had a lot of experiences. But I've never worn one with an all-seeing, all-listening AI companion by my side until this week when I got my first taste at Google's headquarters in New York City. Android XR, which is available in early form for developers now and will fully launch in 2025, promises a whole OS for headsets and glasses of all types and is a bridge to Android phones. But its killer app, the one Google is clearly banking on, is its AI, Gemini. From what I've seen, it's a heck of a sign of how much headsets and glasses will be changing in the next few years… but I still have a lot of questions about how it'll fit into everyday life. What I remember most clearly afterward, my head buzzing with an hour's worth of demo memories in headset and glasses, is wandering through worlds with the persistence of an AI companion. For instance, I was standing on a 3D map of my own neighborhood, my home below me. I pinched and zoomed, hovering over my roof, until I could see the horizon and some buildings a few streets away. I pointed to them. "What's that building over there?" I asked. "That's the high school," Gemini said, identifying my town's school name. I get closer and ask about the municipal building next door too. We explored my town together, Gemini and I, in a new Samsung mixed-reality headset that feels a lot like Apple's Vision Pro headset. But as I asked Gemini to take me to other places -- beyond Maps to Chrome or YouTube, where it helped me recognize things in videos, or narrated scenes on the fly -- or even pointed out and searched for things in the real world in a constructed living room space at Google's New York headquarters -- I started to lose track of what app I was in. Gemini was always with me, though. And after a few demos, Gemini even told me what I'd done and jogged my memory in case I forgot. A lot of it starts to feel like those dreams of sci-fi assistants, and that's not accidental. Google's President of Android Ecosystem, Sameer Samat, equates multimodal AI to a "Tony Stark" moment: "What these [AI] models can do using the cameras on the phone as a way of interacting with the world, it was truly blowing us away. Wouldn't this be perfect for a pair of glasses?" During a long exclusive conversation with Samat, it became clear that AI has motivated Google to rewrite its future AR/VR plans and re-enter a space it walked away from years ago after ending support for the Google Daydream. And yes, Google and Samsung have a lot of AR/VR plans for 2025: Android XR will launch then, and so will Samsung's headset. But Android XR will also work with Android phones and other headsets and glasses ranging from VR to AR to Meta Ray-Ban-like smart glasses. Glasses are very much on Google's roadmap. I also got multiple demos of display-enabled, Gemini-equipped smart glasses from others, each with floating head-up displays. These glasses, part of Google's AI initiative code-named Project Astra, are part of what's coming next. It's a lot to take in. But it's all a massive taste of what will probably be a big shift to AI living on XR very soon. It's fascinating stuff and also a lot to digest. I've said it for years: the big missing piece in VR and AR has been our phones. To this point, iOS and Android haven't been deeply connected with VR and AR headsets and glasses. But Android XR, a new platform launching in 2025 that was announced for developers Thursday, will open that all up. Starting with Samsung's Vision Pro-like mixed reality headset, Google aims to create a universe of glasses, goggles and headsets to interconnect with Google Play, run multiple 2D apps at once and use Gemini AI. Google's making AI a big part of the reason for Android XR, and its biggest feature. In that sense, it's already different from Meta and Apple, which have slow-played AI in VR and AR so far. Apple Intelligence still hasn't emerged on Vision Pro yet, but is likely to arrive next year. While Meta has generative AI already running on its Ray-Ban smart glasses, the Meta Quest VR headsets don't have a lot of AI tools baked in yet. Android XR is only in its early stages, a preview form for early partners to start getting used to. Google is working with Samsung first as its starting hardware partner, with the mixed reality headset I got to briefly try being the first product next year. Samsung is also making glasses, which we don't know much about yet… in the meantime, Google also has its own in-house smart glasses called Project Astra (I got to try those too). There will be other partners and other products: Xreal, which already has a wide range of display glasses and a new set of AI-ready Xreal One glasses, is one of them. But for the year to come, it'll mostly be about Google and Samsung, with hardware using chipsets made by Qualcomm. Even though Android XR's starting point is a high-end VR headset, the endpoint is a whole range of products to come. "This is not just about one product," says Kihwan Kim, executive VP of Immersive technologies and hardware at Samsung. Kim sees it as the foundation for what will be a range of devices, including glasses. "This is more like the route to making this market," Kim says. Meta's Orion glasses, which I saw earlier in the fall, are years away from being a reality but show what AR glasses could be. No one is there yet, though, and Google, like everyone else, is splitting the difference to get there. "We have this kind of parallel approach," Shahram Izadi, Google's VP and GM for XR, says about the headset/glasses strategy. "One starts with a lot of capabilities, one starts with limited capabilities, but you're locking on form factor. Most people are attacking these two vectors to get to all-day wearable AR glasses." Project Moohan is a familiar-looking mixed reality-enabled VR headset. It'll be the first Android XR-enabled product next year. I was one of only a few people to get an early hands-on with Samsung's Android XR headset and only got to wear it for a half hour or so. It's called Project Moohan, and Google didn't allow me to take any photos or videos of my demos or the mixed reality headset. The feel of the hardware is very familiar: It has the fit and feel of a Meta Quest Pro but the video quality of an Apple Vision Pro. The headset's clear lenses and visor-like design perch over my forehead, resting over my eyes without needing a face piece pressing in. The headband design tightens in the back, and it's lightweight, but there's also a tethered battery pack, much like the Vision Pro, which I tuck in my pocket. Google outfitted me with prescription lenses for my demos, which was a huge help since the headset doesn't seem made to fit over glasses. The hardware has both eye tracking and hand tracking, just like Vision Pro, and uses a color camera passthrough of the real world overlaid with what's shown in VR on the headset, creating mixed reality much like Meta's Quest 3 or Vision Pro. Project Moohan is what Google and Samsung started with awhile ago, before a rapid rise in generative AI interest and capabilities that, according to Samat, led the team to pivot toward an agent-based Gemini system that would work on both headsets and glasses. But Moohan is the starting point that Google feels can cover enough bases of interaction, Google Play app compatibility, AI and interface that it can fuel ideas in a wave of other, smaller glasses that may not have all these features eventually. The windowed feel of Android XR looks a lot like Vision OS, but Gemini AI can also see what you're seeing. Tapping on the side of the headband opens up a grid of Google Play apps, much like how Vision Pro (or my Meta Orion demo) worked. I can pinch open apps with my hand by casting a pointer in space, and app windows can be dragged around by the edges and expanded in size. A top button on the headset can bring me back to the home screen, which includes an immersive 3D landscape that, again, is very Vision Pro. Google's demos were all of Google apps, several of which aren't on other headsets yet, namely, Maps and YouTube. Google Maps starts in 2D but can launch a full 3D view that feels like the Google Earth experience I tried in VR years ago. Landscapes spread around magically, with searchable locations studded throughout. Google's also adding full 3D-scanned locations over time using a technique called Gaussian splatting, which knits 2D photos into realistic (but a bit hazy) walkable rooms. I popped into a scan of Scarpetta, a New York restaurant, and entered the dining rooms. I've seen these types of scans at Meta and via companies like Varjo and Niantic, but it's fun to see them knitted into Maps. YouTube feels like a standard viewer with pop-out panes for comments and metadata, but it can also play immersive 3D, 180- and 360-degree videos that have been on YouTube for years. There's another trick too: Google is using AI to convert 2D YouTube videos into 3D. It didn't look bad, and more impressively, it works with home videos in the Photos app, too, along with 2D-to-3D photo conversions. Apple already converts 2D photos to 3D in Vision Pro, but the video trick is a next-level move for immersive memories. Android XR can show photos, and videos, and convert them all into 3D. I also dragged my Chrome browser over to a table to demo how swapping to mouse and keyboard from hand tracking would work, and the transition was pretty seamless; the mouse cursor moved all around the room, not just in the browser window. When I lifted my hand off the mouse, hand tracking was instantly back in action. My demo didn't have eye tracking enabled (maybe because of my prescription inserts), but the headset and Android XR are made to adapt to whatever inputs are available: hands, eyes, voice or things like keyboards, mice or connected phones. (The headset does have automatic eye distance adjustment, by the way.) There's no price or release date for Samsung's headset, or even an official name -- Moohan refers to "infinity" in Korean -- and it's available only for developers now. But it feels like a very real product, and it runs off Qualcomm's XR2 Plus Gen 2 chips announced back in January. But again, it's the Gemini AI that feels like the special ingredient right now. My demos were pretty contained in a pre-set space with preconfigured apps, but Gemini seemed like a pretty compelling magic trick. The magic continued on glasses in another room. Google's prototype smart glasses showing Project Astra look pretty normal, but have a display inside one lens. Samsung's next product will be smart glasses, with more details coming in 2025. But these glasses don't exist yet. Instead, Google is currently experimenting with its own in-house glasses, part of an AI initiative called Project Astra, which are being field-tested now to get feedback on how they work and feel in public. The second room I entered had a number of pairs of these glasses, one outfitted with a temporary pair of makeshift prescription inserts for me. The glasses look pretty normal, lightweight and wireless (like Meta's Ray-Bans), with a camera onboard and speakers and mics in the arms, along with a few input buttons. These glasses have a single display in the right lens, projected in via a Micro LED chip on the arm onto etched waveguides on a small square patch on the lens glass. They feel like a modern riff on Google Glass, but with much better tech. The display mainly shows text: directional information or captions of whatever Gemini might be saying to me through the speakers. Google's representation of what heads-up displays in their smart glasses look like. My experience was pretty close to this, but I didn't set up a shelf. I wandered around the room, looking at books on the shelf and asking about them (Jeff Vandermeer's Absolution, for instance, which I asked about and whether I needed to read the other books first). I opened up a Yuval Noah Harari book and asked Gemini to summarize what was in front of me. I also had them translate a poster on the wall. Meta's Ray-Bans can already do this too, but Gemini, once invoked, stays active and doesn't need additional prompts. Instead of always re-activating, I keep it on… and pause it by tapping on the side of the glasses when I want an Assistant break. I also got to demo a live translation, where someone else in the room approached me to speak in English and then Spanish. Everything she said to me was auto-captioned in the head-up display, and it all kept being delivered in English even when she changed languages. This representation of what Maps looks like on glasses was like what I experienced on dual-display prototypes, but in a contained demo space. Another short demo showed where the tech aims to go next: A pair of glasses with dual displays gave me simulated map information, and when I looked down, I saw a 3D map appear to guide my orientation and show me what street I was facing. Looking up and spinning around, I saw a map appear when I was in motion, then fade away when I was still. I also saw a brief video clip to show the potential resolution of the display; the micro-LED color and pixel density looked really good, but the square field of view was pretty small. Google sees it expanding over time, but it was notably smaller than the Meta Orion prototype, Xreal's glasses and even Snap's developer Spectacles. Then again, right now, Google and its hardware partners like Samsung may be taking small steps for how much visual detail is even delivered on these glasses without feeling like an interruption or unsafe to use in public while walking around. Meta sees headsets and glasses as two parallel classes of products like PCs and phones, and Google feels the same way. "You'll probably use the more immersive products akin to laptops. On the glasses side, these are more like smartphones of the future or wearable devices of the future like watches or buds. So you have to support both," Izadi says. A representation of what instant translation would look like. How will this feel in the outdoor everyday world? Through all of these demos, Gemini's one-tap-away readiness was a constant. That's clearly Google's push here by design. But it's also the most eye-opening, surprising part of everything I experienced. AI, no matter what your concerns about it might be, can be extremely helpful in a headset or glasses where inputs like a keyboard or touchscreen are harder to access. I use Siri a lot more in Vision Pro or with AirPods. Meta's Ray-Bans use voice as a deeper way to control things too. However, current VR/AR devices have limits to how aware the AI feels. Gemini, because it can see everything you're seeing in real time, feels like it's a buddy… and maybe not one you'll always want. I found Gemini bubbly and friendly at first (it said "Hi!" and I awkwardly said "hi" back) but then settled into a listening mode where anything I said could be interpreted as instruction -- there's no "hey Gemini" prompt. That makes things helpful but also intrusive. The way to stop it is to pause it or turn it off again, which feels like the reverse of how AI assistants work now: Instead of tapping to invoke, you tap to stop it. No doubt, Gemini will have limits on how much it can run continuously on small glasses, just from a battery perspective. According to Google, in mixed reality VR like Project Moohan, Gemini works as a layer that uses casting to interpret everything it sees. It can even be used while playing games, though there might be a bit of a performance hit. The advantages could be how it can continuously break the fourth wall of mixed reality, in a sense: I could "circle to search" things in Chrome and have responses pop up, or pull 3D objects into my world on command, or jump from app to app as I request a location or a video or ask to play music from an album I see in front of me (which happened during my demo). Samsung's Kim suggests I could get tutorials while playing games, for instance, if Gemini sees what I'm doing in the headset or even with glasses. And, of course, it can remember what I was doing, too, and when. Although, when I asked Gemini to recognize my colleague Lisa Eadicicco in the room with me, it said it couldn't be used to identify people (yet). Google's already laying out wide-sweeping plans for Gemini 2, just announced, to be an agent-like system that works across devices. Adding camera feeds into the AI input mix also means more data to collect and train with. It won't just be on headsets and glasses, and Google isn't the only company pursuing this vision. The implications are vast. "The assistant is coming with you, whether it's your glasses, your headset, your phone, your watch," Izadi says. Would I want Gemini to see everything I'm doing? No, of course not. Microsoft experimented with an always-on Recall AI mode in Windows before delaying it after backlash. How Google will handle that dance between always-helpful and privacy-invasive is unclear, although Google promises that video feeds used for AI recognition are kept private and local. The shape of future Android XR products remains unknown, but expect lots of glasses. One big thing seems clear, though: With Android XR, all sorts of headsets and glasses will be able to bridge into phones more easily than before. That could allow a whole host of otherwise isolated products to feel more knitted together in a way that Apple and Meta haven't done yet (although the exact steps for how that happens aren't clear for Google, either). Google's Samat points to Samsung being the first partner to co-explore the software, but Qualcomm's existing Snapdragon Spaces software, which bridges phones to glasses already, will also be compatible and part of Android XR. Google's also enabling WebXR and Unity tools to work with Android XR, and existing 2D Google Play apps will all run in Android XR, as long as a developer agrees to opt in to listing them there. Individual hardware makers should be able to customize their own software and tools and still connect to Google Play, but what about putting Google's already widespread services on other devices too? Right now, Google isn't offering any specifics there, but having XR Maps and YouTube -- and Gemini -- on Quest and Vision Pro headsets and elsewhere would be helpful. It could also change the way developers envision future VR and AR apps. "While we are looking to bring existing games like Demeo to Android XR, the platform also opens us up to develop entirely new ideas," Tommy Palm, head of Resolution Games, a developer that's made games for lots of existing VR/AR hardware, tells CNET. "Android XR's open nature, developer-friendly approach and unique innovations make it not only viable but allow us to consider new and novel ways to use mixed reality for storytelling. For instance, the natural language interface of ChatBots could be a very potent extension for XR and games." These moves are early, but they're also pointers to what's happening next. Apple and Meta will undoubtedly have more AI services in AR and VR in the years to come, and Apple will likely find ways to let Vision work with iPhones. Or they need to. Google's plans make a lot of sense, and they'll probably let headsets and glasses work as true peripherals to phones and, eventually, with watches too. With three partners in the equation -- Google, Samsung, and Qualcomm -- and other manufacturers too – it could get messy. But it's also the unifying progress that an already fragmented future landscape needs. We'll know more about what's really happening in 2025, which isn't very far away at all.

I’ve seen a headset like this before... I’ve seen a headset like this before... by  Jay Peters Samsung has its Project Moohan headset on display at Galaxy Unpacked, and we’ve just taken a bunch of pictures of it. This technically isn’t the first time we’ve seen Project Moohan, but it is the first time we’ve been allowed to photograph it. To me, it looks somewhat similar to Apple’s high-end Vision Pro headset with a hint of Meta’s discontinued Quest Pro. The headset, which Samsung is developing in partnership with Google, runs Android XR, an OS designed specifically for headsets and smart glasses. My colleague Victoria Song got to try Project Moohan late last year, so if you want to know what it’s like to actually wear and use, go check out her impressions. Samsung plans to launch Project Moohan for developers first, but it won’t be available right away for consumers.

TITLE: Samsung XR headset display set to go toe-to-toe with Apple Vision Pro

--------------------------------------------------
CONTENT:
Samsung’s answer to Apple’s Vision Pro headset has been teased for months now, but there’s little information about what hardware and specs it will offer. Now, though, data on the device is starting to come out, including that it will reportedly use a 4K micro-OLED display from Sony. According to Korean site The Elec, highlighted by UploadVR, the Samsung XR headset will use a Sony 1.35-inch micro-OLED display, which is the same hardware that Sony is using in its own flip-up XR headset, the Sony SRH-S1. That is an exceedingly expensive model, costing even more than Apple’s Vision Pro at $4,750 and therefore aimed more at the enterprise market than at your average consumer. But the Samsung XR offering is more of a Vision Pro competitor, presumably for a more mainstream audience. If the reports are correct, the Samsung XR offering would have a slightly smaller display than the Vision Pro, at 1.35 inches compared to 1.4 inches, but with better resolution of 3552×3840 compared to Apple’s 3660×3200. UploadVR also points out that the new display will have a wider color gamut with 96% DCI-P3 coverage, compared to 92% for the Apple Vision Pro. In its first year of sales, the Vision Pro hasn’t proven hugely popular — likely at least in part due to its hefty $3,500 price tag — and customers are asking for a more affordable model. Whether or not Apple comes forward with a more budget friendly option, other companies are getting interested in filling that niche with a range of upcoming rivals to be released. As well as Sony and Samsung’s headsets, Meta has shown interest in expanding its Quest headset lineup, possibly working with LG. Whether any of these companies can produce a device that has enough functionality to match the Vision Pro whilst still being affordable, however, remains to be seen. As well as its XR headset, Samsung has also dropped info that it is working on smart glasses, but little information is available on these yet. And Apple may be working on a refreshed Vision Pro, so this year promises to be an exciting one for fans of VR. It’s just over a year since Apple first listed its Vision Pro headset for sale, and the device hasn’t exactly lit the world on fire since then. Yet after a year of reflection, there’s one thing that Apple very clearly needs to do if it’s going to get its mixed-reality headset back on track. That thing is to launch a more affordable model, pure and simple. It goes against Apple’s preferred way of doing things -- the company is used to making the best, most premium devices it can and pricing them accordingly -- but it’s the only way the company is going to be able to make its headset go truly mainstream.
Sticker shock At Galaxy Unpacked 2025, Samsung teased its upcoming XR headset, Project Moohan. This Vision Pro competitor is expected to launch later this year at a significantly lower cost than Apple's spatial computer. Samsung's mention was quite brief but we do have plenty of information about this exciting new device that's expected to arrive later this year. Samsung isn't new to XR and with the backing of two other tech giants, Project Moohan could become a serious threat to Apple's Vision Pro and VR market leader Meta and its Quest 3 headset.
Samsung's XR history
While it might seem like Samsung is rushing to build a headset to answer Apple's Vision Pro, Samsung has a long history of VR development, starting with the GearVR system in 2015. Fast forward eight years to the Galaxy Unpacked 2023 event to see the first mention of work on Samsung's XR headset in partnership with Google and Qualcomm. Many tech brands are developing next-generation innovations for upcoming products, giving the industry just a taste of what can be expected in the future. Samsung is one brand leading the charge, as its Samsung Display sector is a primary supplier for display panels throughout the industry. It recently showcased several upcoming technologies, including a 27-inch 5K QD-OLED display. FlatPanelsHD spoke with Samsung Display at CES 2025, where the publication received a private demo of the next generation QD-OLED monitors with a 220 PPI (pixels per inch) pixel density.

TITLE: Samsung's Android XR headset could avoid the Apple Vision Pro's biggest mistake, according to this leak

But there's still a chance that Samsung will slip up When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Samsung and Google’s XR headset – currently known as Project Moohan – is shaping up to be an Apple Vision Pro competitor with high-end specs (like a rumored OLED display) and a sleek design, but it also looks set to avoid its rival’s biggest blunder: a lack of first-party controllers. Samsung had already confirmed the headset would be compatible with both controllers and hand gestures when it announced the device, but now a report from SamMobile reveals that Samsung will be making its own first-party handsets – after the publication discovered references to controllers with the model number ET-OI610. It’s unclear what form these controllers will take – they could look like standard VR motion controllers or more like a gamepad – and we won’t know more until designs leak or Samsung shows them off officially.It also isn’t clear if they’ll ship with the headset or as an add-on, but I seriously hope Samsung puts them in the box, and doesn't repeat the mistake made by Apple with its Vision Pro headset.  The Apple Vision Pro had several faults, but perhaps the biggest unforced error was Apple’s decision to not ship it with controllers, as is standard for its XR competitors. This one decision is the biggest reason why the Vision Pro sorely lacked tentpole XR software that you can find elsewhere – and why it took so long for a handful of titles to make their way to the system. When I’ve spoken to XR software developers who have created games and apps for the Meta Quest, Steam, and Vive platforms, the biggest challenge they told me they face with the Vision Pro is its lack of controllers. Moreover, the Vision Pro uses a somewhat bespoke version of hand-tracking which relies on eye-tracking, making its control scheme almost entirely different to any other platform's. Generally, porting software from one XR headset to another is straightforward – there are some things that need to be changed based on specs, but the core game or app can remain pretty much as-is. Because the Vision Pro is so different in its control scheme I was told that for many games and apps it would be as easy to create a whole new title as it would be to port an existing one designed for a different VR headset, given the amount of redesigning that would be required – and that would be both time-consuming and costly for developers.While it appears that Samsung and Google will dodge the overarching issue by at least producing first-party controllers, they could still manage to shoot themselves in the foot, as the reports don't say whether the first-party controllers will be included in the box. Not including the controllers is likely to leave a bad taste in customers' mouths and might impact sales, which could also be an issue for developers. The Android XR device is expected to be fairly pricey, and nickel-and-diming buyers by asking them to pay extra for controllers wouldn’t be ideal.

TITLE: Samsung’s New Android XR Headset Shows Everyone Underestimated the Apple Vision Pro
URL: https://www.gizmodo.com/samsungs-project-moohan-vision-pros-best-features-2000555771
--------------------------------------------------
CONTENT:
Everybody copies Apple, even the tech giantâs missteps. Samsung is working on its own VR/AR helmet dubbed âProject Moohan,â along with a pair of AR glasses. The first video to finally show off its capabilities in full seems to cement Samsung and Googleâs biggest inspiration for its new headset, which was the too-often maligned and too-expensive Vision Pro. While some select journalists and industry insiders had someÂ hands-on time with the headset last year, this is the first time the rest of us have seen it in person.Â Tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee shared the firstÂ footage of the inside and outside of the helmet.Â It gives us a first look at the hyped AndroidXR ecosystem and its controls. If you have seen or used a Vision Pro or even a Meta Quest 3Â orÂ Quest 3S, youâll get a thick sense of deja vu. Even from pictures, the device strongly resembles Appleâs $3,500 headset. The device even has an external battery pack that can slip into your pocket. Samsungâs device has made some improvements to Appleâs design. For one, the cable to the battery pack is a simple USB-C that can plug into any external battery if you run low on the base unit. The front screen is glass, though thereâs no EyeSight feature trying to resemble peopleâs eyes on the gogglesâ front. The headset is also much more comfortable, according to Brownlee. The device includes a shield that puts the weight on the brow rather than the nose, unlike the Vision Pro. The similarities donât end there. The headset includes hand and eye tracking with AR passthrough. Like Vision Pro and the Meta Quest 3, after recent updates, you can use a pinch gesture to move windows around your environment and prop them up where itâs most convenient for you. Thereâs even an open-palm gesture to open an app list that scrolls left and right with pinch gestures, just like Appleâs âspatial computer.â According to Brownlee, Google will modify some of its most popular apps, like YouTube, to work on AndroidXR, but the rest of the app list should also be compatible. The headset has automatic IPD adjustment and a UI closer to the HTC Vive or Meta Quest than the Vision Proâs long eye-tracking setup. The big difference between Vision Pro and Moohan is that the latter has access to AI. Gemini exists on the top bar of the app menu and is accessible with a pinch. This grants you a version of Gemini Live for continuous conversation with Googleâs chatbot. The AI is meant to be the kind of cross-app AI assistant we saw first-hand with the Samsung Galaxy S25 phones. This version, however, also works directly with the headsetâs passthrough capabilities. Brownlee looked at an image of a magazine cover from Dubai, then asked the headset to âtake me there.â The device loaded up Google Maps centered on the UAE and then dropped into street view. The other addition is a vision-capable version of Googleâs Circle to Search. This lets you search for an object based on what you see in front of you, though the cameras also tended to take a picture of Brownleeâs hand while he circled the object in front of him. Brownlee said Moohan is a âdeep collaborationâ between Samsung and Google, which isnât big news considering the two companies’ buddy-buddy relationship with Samsung Galaxy phones. Google would want AndroidXR to be as prolific as Android is on phones. However, Meta has already tried to tip the scales in its direction with HorizonOS. Meta made its operating system (ironically built on Android Open Source Project or AOSP) available to outside OEMs. Meta tipped that companies, including Asus, had their own headsets on the way. Recent leaks suggest the Asus âTariusâ headset could arrive sometime this year. As somebody who used both visionOS and HorizonOS extensively last year, I think AndroidXR seems likeâat mostâan evolution. The one missing element with Vision Pro is controller support, though Samsung has yet to confirm Moohan will offer controller configurations. Brownlee speculated controller support is in the cards, but their usefulness will depend on how many AR or VR games and apps will be available. While there are relatively few VR games worth playing on the Play Store, weâll hopefully be able to connect with the Steam Link app or another app like Virtual Desktop to connect with PCVR titles. Both Samsung and Apple are reportedly working on AR glasses. Compared to big, bulky headsets, these devices will be easier to transport and wear in public without looking like a space alien who has lost their way. The holy grail is a device with vision and displays as capable as Moohan or the Vision Pro, but the current slate of glasses launching this year is comparatively limited. We’ll see how Meta’s Orion glasses shake out. Still, we’ll be pleasantly surprised if Samsung can somehow crack the ceiling on power and capabilities with its upcoming smart glasses with Android XR.

I demoed Google’s new Android XR platform, Samsung’s Project Moohan, and prototype smart glasses. I felt as close to Tony Stark in a controlled demo as I’ll ever be. by  Victoria Song I demoed Google’s new Android XR platform, Samsung’s Project Moohan, and prototype smart glasses. I felt as close to Tony Stark in a controlled demo as I’ll ever be. by  Victoria Song It’s an ordinary Tuesday. I’m wearing what look like ordinary glasses in a room surrounded by Google and Samsung representatives. One of them steps out in front of me and starts speaking in Spanish. I don’t speak Spanish. Hovering in mid-air, I can see her words being translated into English subtitles. Reading them, I can see she’s describing what I’m seeing in real time. I mumble an expletive. Everyone laughs. This is my first experience with Android XR — a new mixed reality OS designed for headsets and smart glasses, like the prototypes I’m wearing. It’s Google’s big bet to power a new generation of augmented reality devices that embody all our wildest dreams of what smart glasses can be. Google is no stranger to augmented reality. Google Glass crashed and burned with the public more than 10 years ago before being repurposed for enterprise users and eventually discontinued. But things are different now. Apple has the Vision Pro. Meta has the Ray-Ban smart glasses, and their AI features have garnered positive buzz. That’s why Google is jumping back into the fray with Android XR. Google wants everyone to know the time is finally right for XR, and it’s pointing to Gemini as its north star. Adding Gemini enables multimodal AI and natural language — things it says will make interactions with your environment richer. In a demo, Google had me prompt Gemini to name the title of a yellow book sitting behind me on a shelf. I’d briefly glanced at it earlier but hadn’t taken a photo. Gemini took a second, and then offered up an answer. I whipped around to check — it was correct. On top of that, the platform will work with any mobile and tablet app from the Play Store out of the box. Today’s launch is aimed at developers so they can start building out experiences. The average person won’t be able to buy anything running Android XR right now, but in 2025, Samsung will be launching its long-rumored XR headset. Dubbed Project Moohan (Korean for infinity), the headset will be the first consumer product to ship with Android XR. Technically, it’s running the same software as the glasses I tried, but Project Moohan will also be capable of VR and immersive content — stuff that wouldn’t be suited to a pair of smart glasses. It’s essentially a showcase for everything that could be possible. Hence why Google is going with XR — a catch-all term that stands for “extended reality” and encompasses AR, VR, and mixed reality. Samsung’s headset feels like a mix between a Meta Quest 3 and the Vision Pro. Unlike either, the light seal is optional so you can choose to let the world bleed in. It’s lightweight and doesn’t pinch my face too tightly. My ponytail easily slots through the top, and later, I’m thankful that I don’t have to redo my hair. At first, the resolution doesn’t feel quite as sharp as the Vision Pro — until the headset automatically calibrates to my pupillary distance. It’s at this point when I start feeling deja vu. I’m walked through pinching to select items and how to tap the side to bring up the app launcher. There’s an eye calibration process that feels awfully similar to the Vision Pro’s. If I want, I can retreat into an immersive mode to watch YouTube and Google TV on a distant mountain. I can open apps, resize them, and place them at various points around the room. I’ve done this all before. This just happens to be Google-flavored. I want to ask: how do you expect to stand out? I don’t get the chance to before I’m told: Gemini. For the skeptic, it’s easy to scoff at the idea that Gemini, of all things, is what’s going to crack the augmented reality puzzle. Generative AI is having a moment right now, but not always in a positive way. Outside of conferences filled with tech evangelists, AI is often viewed with derision and suspicion. But inside the Project Moohan headset or wearing a pair of prototype smart glasses? I can catch a glimpse of why Google and Samsung believe Gemini is the killer app for XR. For me, it’s the fact that I don’t have to be specific when I ask for things. Usually, I get flustered talking to AI assistants because I have to remember the wake word, clearly phrase my request, and sometimes even specify my preferred app. “One thing I’m really confident about, something that’s not just different from before, is that Gemini is really that great,” says Kihwan Kim, EVP at Samsung Electronics, who nods furiously in agreement when I mention this. To Kim, it’s the ability to fluidly speak to Gemini and the fact that it understands a person’s individual context that opens dozens of different options for the way each person interacts with XR. “That’s why I clearly see that this headset will give more insight about what [XR] should be.” In the Moohan headset, I can say, “Take me to JYP Entertainment in Seoul,” and it will automatically open Google Maps and show me that building. If my windows get cluttered, I can ask it to reorganize them. I don’t have to lift a finger. While wearing the prototype glasses, I watch and listen as Gemini summarizes a long, rambling text message to the main point: can you buy lemon, ginger, and olive oil from the store? I was able to naturally switch from speaking in English to asking in Japanese what the weather is in New York — and get the answer in spoken and written Japanese. It’s not just interactions with Gemini that linger in my mind, either. It’s also how experiences can be built on top of them. I asked Gemini how to get somewhere and saw turn-by-turn text directions. When I looked down, the text morphed into a zoomable map of my surroundings. It’s very easy to imagine myself using something like that in real life. But as cool as all that is, headsets can be a hard sell to the average person. Personally, I’m more enamored with the glasses demo, but those have no concrete timeline. (Google made the prototypes, but it’s focusing on working with other partners to bring hardware to market.) There are still cultural cues that have to be established with either form factor. Outside of Gemini, there has to be a robust ecosystem of apps and experiences for the average person, not just early adopters. “It’s not going to be a singular product. It’s Android,” says Shahram Izadi, Google’s VP of AR and XR, noting that Google has a three-pronged strategy for Android XR: laying the groundwork with devs is one element; Gemini’s conversational experience is another; and the third is the idea that no one device is the future of XR. Headsets, for example, may just be “episodic” devices you use for entertainment. Glasses could supplement phones and smartwatches for discreet notifications and looking up information. “The way I see it, these devices don’t replace one another. You’ll use these devices throughout your day, and if there’s consistency with Gemini and generative AI experiences across these form factors, people will get more comfortable with wearing computers on their faces. That’s the on ramp to get to more immersive devices,” says Izadi. Listening to Kim and Izadi talk, I want to believe. But I’m also acutely aware that all of my experiences were tightly controlled. I wasn’t given free rein to try and break things. I couldn’t take photos of the headset or glasses. At every point, I was carefully guided through preapproved demos that Google and Samsung were reasonably sure would work. I — and every other consumer — can’t fully believe until we can play with these things without guardrails. But even knowing that, I can’t deny that, for an hour, I felt like Tony Stark with Gemini as my Jarvis. For better or worse, this example has molded so much of our expectations for how XR and AI assistants should work. I’ve tried dozens of headsets and smart glasses that promised to make what I see in the movies real — and utterly failed. For the first time, I experienced something relatively close.

Better pixel density could help Samsung compete with Apple When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Samsung’s Project Moohan XR headset might have been on show at MWC 2025, but Samsung didn’t actually give us any information on what to expect from the device. However a new report from The Elec may have revealed some key details, including the fact Samsung could be using a better screen than the one found on the Apple Vision Pro. The site claims that Samsung will be using a pair of Sony’s 1.3-inch 4K OLED on Silicon (OLEDoS) panels in Project Moohan. Apparently these screens will offer a pixel density of 3,800 ppi, which would trump the 3,391ppi Sony displays utilized by Apple. According to the report Sony will begin mass-production of OLEDoS panels for Project Moohan some time next month — ready to be shipped to Samsung. While this doesn’t tell us exactly when the headset will be released, it suggests that it won’t happen anytime soon. So we may have to wait until the next Galaxy Unpacked in the summer to hear more about the company’s XR headset plans.  The Elec also claims Samsung originally planned to release a headset at some point in 2023. However those plans were reportedly delayed after Samsung saw the specifications for the Apple Vision Pro. The site claims Samsung's attitude is that “hardware specifications and manufacturing competitiveness are strengths that Samsung Electronics should highlight.” Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips. In other words, Samsung seemingly wanted to one-up Apple in the emerging mixed reality industry. However, it’s unclear what the original headset could have looked like, only that Samsung has upped the pixel density to account for the fact Moohan is a much newer device than Vision Pro.  The Elec reports that Samsung will be shipping around 100,000 Moohan headsets, and has plans to develop more headsets in the future. A cheaper model is also expected, with the company apparently requesting Samsung Display make two 2.1-inch screens with a pixel density of 1,700ppi. It’s unclear when such a device will be released. It could be that it arrives before Apple’s rumored lower-cost Vision headset, considering the company has reportedly scaled back its XR ambitions due to the Vision Pro’s lukewarm reception. But it’s likely that Samsung will see how the retail version of Project Moohan actually performs first.

TITLE: Project Moohan: Samsung’s XR headset launches this year

--------------------------------------------------
CONTENT:
Samsung used the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2025 to showcase its latest AI-powered innovations and expanded mobile experiences, and show the upcoming Project Moohan XR headset.  Samsung’s upcoming XR headset will have the capability to run all current Android mobile applications. Additionally, there are numerous applications specifically designed for Android XR in development, and Adobe’s Photoshop is probably one of them. On March 3, Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2025 kicked off in Barcelona. The event is the stage where Samsung solidifies its mobile AI leadership, from Galaxy AI to software-centric networks. Star of the show, in a “you can look but do not touch” display, Samsung’s first-ever Android extended reality (XR) headset, Project Moohan, attracted attentions, as it did during the Unpacked event, Samsung’s introduction of the new S25 series, where the device debuted. Crowds gathered at MWC to catch a glimpse of Project Moohan Samsung’s first-ever Android extended reality (XR) headset, which will leverage multimodal AI technology to enable more natural and conversation-like interactions. The Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2025 is the first non-Samsung event where the headset is shown, and it is one of the highlights at the company’s booth in Barcelona. Although a lot is yet not known about the device, Samsung says it offers “a glimpse into the future of AI-powered extended reality. By integrating multimodal AI with advanced XR capabilities, this ground-breaking device marks a significant step toward more context-aware and personalized experiences that enhance everyday life in incredibly immersive ways.” First revealed in February 2023, when Google, Samsung and Qualcomm announced that they would co-develop an XR device, the Project Moohan headset uses a Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 processor, a more powerful version of the chip in Quest 3 and Quest 3S, to power the displays that boast an impressive 3,000 DPI resolution, significantly outperforming the Meta Quest 3’s 1,200 DPI, according to some sources. As we noted before, besides being the first Android XR headset, Project Moohan (or simply Moohan) is compatible with OpenXR, meaning it can be used as a wireless PCVR solution, as it will be able to run Virtual Desktop, the most popular software for wireless experiences on headsets as the Quest, HTC Vive or Pico 4. In fact, Guy Godin, developer of Virtual Desktop, revealed to website UploadVR that bringing his native OpenXR app to Android XR “took only a few hours and the basics just worked out of the box”, adding this: ”Personally I think it’s refreshing to work with a platform that wants to collaborate with developers rather than one who tries to block and copy us. Grateful to have more options for consumers in the near future and I’m very excited to bring the best PC streaming solution to Android XR.” The latest news, published by TheElec, suggest that Samsung’s Moohan will use Sony’s 1.3-inch OLEDoS display with 3,800 pixels per inch (ppi), a higher resolution than Apple Vision Pro’s display (also made by Sony), which is 1.42-inch in size with a resolution of 3,391 ppi. The website also notes that “Apple is also preparing to launch a budget model XR headset” as “Vision Pro’s high price tag had been considered a barrier to mass adoption. Lack of contents is also posing a challenge.” Samsung’s Moohan will be available later in 2025, with a suggested price under $1000, which will make it one of the most affordable high-end XR headsets, competing with the upcoming Play For Dream, which already announced it aims to sue Android XR as well, meaning these could be the first Android XR headsets to reach the market. In terms of software, there is a lot of content already available, according to Google,  all existing Android mobile apps will work on Android XR. Many of those apps will be available through Google’s Play Store, which started to make references to XR headsets back in October 2024… preparing for what’s ahead. Apps designed for large tablet screens, a group that includes many of the best Android apps in different categories will work well in the XR headsets, but Google is working to create a vibrant ecosystem of developers and device makers for Android XR, building on the foundation that brought Android to billions. At the end of 2024 Google announced its Android XR SDK Developer preview, and said that “by supporting tools like ARCore, Android Studio, Jetpack Compose, Unity, and OpenXR from the beginning, developers can easily start building apps and games for upcoming Android XR devices. For Qualcomm partners like Lynx, Sony and XREAL, we are opening a path for the development of a wide array of Android XR devices to meet the diverse needs of people and businesses. And, we are continuing to collaborate with Magic Leap on XR technology and future products with AR and AI.” One of the companies mentioned in early information about Android XR and Project Moohan is Adobe. The website XR Today notes, in a piece of news, that “Moohan already has some key business partnerships in place. Adobe’s creative suite integration suggests strong potential for design and creative work, while partnerships with companies like MLB demonstrate its enterprise capabilities.” While it will be possible to run Adobe’s Creative Suite directly in the Moohan headset using a software like Virtual Desktop, which allows for the creation of multiple virtual high-resolution screens, the recent announcement by Adobe that it will have a new Photoshop for Android version later this year suggests that the new app may be launched when Project Moohan hits the market. The app is now available for iPhone. According to Adobe, “the new mobile app is designed from the ground up to welcome a new generation of image and design enthusiasts to the limitless potential of Photoshop in an easy-to-use mobile interface. Photoshop’s new app brings existing customers more flexibility with the ability to make edits anywhere, access their work on the go, capture ideas or dive into personal projects – all in the palm of their hands. The next generation of creators, as well as experienced creative professionals who want to make unique digital art on mobile, can now get started with Photoshop faster and easier than ever before. It will be an interesting experience to use the app viewing it through the high-resolution screens used for the Moohan XR headset, which in fact is being designed to be a tool for content creators, from Virtual Production to post production. For now, though, Samsung’s Project Moohan XR headset is a “don’t touch” device attracting attention at every event where it is displayed.

Samsung will launch its extended reality headset this year, a spokesperson for the company told CNBC on Tuesday. The device, dubbed Project Moohan, is Samsung's answer to Apple's $3,500 Vision Pro, which was launched last year. Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are Samsung teased the headset last year and put it on display at this year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Samsung refers to the product as "extended reality" or XR device which aims to merge the digital and physical world. However, there are currently few details about the device. Four cameras are visible in the front lens of the physical headset and there appears to be touch controls on the side. Get Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox with NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter. Samsung worked alongside both Qualcomm and Google to develop a new kind of operating system for these kind of devices, known as the Android XR platform. In December, Samsung said Google Gemini would be installed in the headset allowing wearers to experience a "conversation user interface."  This would presumably enable users to interact with Gemini, Google's AI assistant, to help navigate through apps and tasks. The cameras also suggest there will be some sort of gesture control similar to Apple's Vision Pro. "To me, the breakthrough technology is a combination of advanced vision capability with intelligence that understands user intention. I think without the intelligence part, it's a defective product," Patrick Chomet, executive vice president at Samsung's mobile division, told CNBC in an interview on Tuesday. Chomet hinted at a world envisioned by many consumer electronics firms, where smarter AI digital assistants are able to more intuitively understand user requirements on a device. Samsung was one of the early players in virtual reality headsets, a market that never really took off the way many companies had predicted. But with technology advancing in areas from displays to chips, mixed or extended reality has been touted by big players as a new frontier in computing. Samsung teased a future product roadmap during a January presentation when it launched its flagship S25 series of smartphones. One slide of the presentation showed outlines of future devices including a trifold smartphone, similar to Huawei's Mate XT, as well as the Project Moohan headset. The final product was a pair of glasses, which could hint at a different type of future XR headset. Smart glasses offer similar experiences to a headset but without wearing a bulky device. Companies including Meta, Snap and XReal have been developing so-called augmented reality glasses. AR is when digital images are overlaid on the real world in front of you. CNBC reported last year that Samsung, Qualcomm and Google were collaborating on a mixed-reality set of glasses. Samsung appeared to confirm such a collaboration at the S25 event in January. Chomet did not give a timeline for the launch of a glasses product. However, he said that it is likely people will use multiple devices. "Probably for quite some time still the smartphone will be the most used device," Chomet said. "I see a world where people have various things including in their home, in their car. And the device will help you accomplish what you need to accomplish."
